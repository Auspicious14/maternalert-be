THIS IS ACCORDING TO WHO

Pre-eclampsia is a high blood pressure disorder that typically develops after 20 weeks into pregnancy. It can present serious risks to both mother and baby. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent progression to eclampsia, which involves seizures. Both conditions can be life-threatening.

Diagnosis

Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed based on the onset of hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg) proteinuria (protein in the urine) (≥0.3 g/24 hours) after 20 weeks of gestation. Severe pre-eclampsia may include symptoms such as severe headaches, visual disturbances and upper abdominal pain.

Risk factors

Several factors can increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. Understanding these risk factors is essential for proactive monitoring and management. Having a risk factor doesn't always mean pre-eclampsia will occur, but closer medical supervision beyond routine screening is recommended.

Several factors can increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, including:

first-time pregnancies
multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.)
obesity
pre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or kidney disease
family history of pre-eclampsia.
Symptoms

Symptoms of pre-eclampsia can vary significantly among individuals. While some may experience a range of noticeable symptoms, others may remain asymptomatic. It is important to be aware of potential indicators and seek medical attention if any concerns arise during pregnancy or after childbirth.

Common symptoms of pre-eclampsia include:

persistent high blood pressure
proteinuria
severe headaches
visual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision, seeing spots)
upper abdominal pain
nausea and vomiting (after the first trimester)
swelling in the hands and face.
Complications

Pre-eclampsia, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby. These complications can range from short-term issues to long-term health problems. Prompt medical intervention is crucial to minimize these risks.

Complications can be severe and include:

eclampsia (seizures)
HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count)
organ damage (kidneys, liver, brain)
placental abruption
preterm birth
fetal growth restriction
maternal and fetal death.
Treatment and management

The primary treatment for pre-eclampsia is the administration of magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures.

The treatment and management of pre-eclampsia depend on the severity of the condition and the gestational age of the pregnancy. The goal is to prevent complications.

Other management strategies include:

antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure
corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity if preterm delivery is anticipated
close monitoring of maternal and fetal health.
Prevention

While there's no guaranteed way to prevent pre-eclampsia, certain strategies can help lower the risk. Early and consistent prenatal care is essential for monitoring and managing potential risk factors.

Preventive measures focus on regular prenatal care to monitor for early signs of pre-eclampsia. Recommendations include:

regular blood pressure checks
urine tests for protein
monitoring for symptoms such as headaches and visual disturbances
lifestyle considerations, such as maintaining a healthy weight and activity (when permitted)
managing pre-existing conditions, especially pre-existing high blood pressure.
Additional prevention measures include:

low dose of aspirin by 20 weeks or when antenatal care begins
calcium supplementation during pregnancy in settings with low dietary intake
treatment of pre-existing high blood pressure with antihypertensive medications.
WHO response

The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed guidelines to improve health during pregnancy. This includes prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and continuously reviewing evidence to see if revisions in the recommendations are needed so that improvements in care can be effected. These guidelines aim to reduce maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality by promoting evidence-based clinical practices. Key WHO recommendations include:

calcium supplementation during pregnancy in areas with low dietary calcium intake
low-dose aspirin during pregnancy for women at high risk of pre-eclampsia
use of magnesium sulfate for the prevention of eclampsia
training healthcare providers in the early detection and management of pre-eclampsia
strengthening health systems to ensure timely and effective care for pregnant women.
By implementing these guidelines, WHO aims to address the profound inequities in maternal and perinatal health globally and achieve the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 


END OF WHO




The causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia are not known. These disorders previously were believed to be caused by a toxin, called “toxemia,” in the blood, but health care providers now know that is not true. Nevertheless, preeclampsia is sometimes still referred to as “toxemia.”

To learn more about preeclampsia and eclampsia, scientists are investigating many factors that could contribute to the development and progression of these diseases, including:

Placental abnormalities, such as insufficient blood flow
Genetic factors
Environmental exposures
Nutritional factors
Maternal immunology and autoimmune disorders
Cardiovascular and inflammatory changes
Hormonal imbalances 

Risks During Pregnancy
Preeclampsia during pregnancy is mild in the majority of cases.1 However, a woman can progress from mild to severe preeclampsia or to full eclampsia very quickly―even in a matter of days. Both preeclampsia and eclampsia can cause serious health problems for the mother and infant.

Women with preeclampsia are at increased risk for damage to the kidneys, liver, brain, and other organ and blood systems. Preeclampsia may also affect the placenta. The condition could lead to a separation of the placenta from the uterus (referred to as placental abruption), preterm birth, and pregnancy loss or stillbirth. In some cases, preeclampsia can lead to organ failure or stroke.

In severe cases, preeclampsia can develop into eclampsia, which includes seizures. Seizures in eclampsia may cause a woman to lose consciousness and twitch uncontrollably.2 If the fetus is not delivered, these conditions can cause the death of the mother and/or the fetus.

Although most pregnant women in developed countries survive preeclampsia, it is still a major cause of illness and death globally.3 According to the World Health Organization, preeclampsia and eclampsia cause 14% of maternal deaths each year, or about 50,000 to 75,000 women worldwide.4


Risks After Pregnancy
In "uncomplicated preeclampsia," the mother's high blood pressure and other symptoms usually go back to normal within 6 weeks of the infant's birth. However, studies have shown that women who had preeclampsia are four times more likely to later develop hypertension (high blood pressure) and are twice as likely to later develop ischemic heart disease (reduced blood supply to the heart muscle, which can cause heart attacks), a blood clot in a vein, and stroke as are women who did not have preeclampsia.5

Less commonly, mothers who had preeclampsia can experience permanent damage to their organs, such as their kidneys and liver. They can also experience fluid in the lungs. In the days following birth, women with preeclampsia remain at increased risk for developing eclampsia and seizures.3,6

In some women, preeclampsia develops between 48 hours and 6 weeks after they deliver their baby—a condition called postpartum preeclampsia.7,8 Postpartum preeclampsia can occur in women who had preeclampsia during pregnancy and among those who did not. One study found that slightly more than one-half of women who had postpartum preeclampsia did not have preeclampsia during pregnancy.9 If a woman has seizures within 72 hours of delivery, she may have postpartum eclampsia. It is important to recognize and treat postpartum preeclampsia and eclampsia because the risk of complications may be higher than if the conditions had occurred during pregnancy.10 Postpartum preeclampsia and eclampsia can progress very quickly if not treated and may lead to stroke or death.
